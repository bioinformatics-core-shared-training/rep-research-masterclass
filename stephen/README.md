My slides are an HTML deck, [neurocase1.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/rep-research-masterclass/gh-pages/stephen/neurocase1.html).

To view my slides, either recompile the html file from source or download the
html file and view it locally  (you can't view it in github, except
through the link in the prev para...).

To recompile, you need the rmarkdown package and a recent version of
pandoc; rstudio has them both.  "make" will them compile the html files.
