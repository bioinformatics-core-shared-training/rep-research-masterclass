# Postdoc Masterclass on Reproducible Research 
## Wednesday 8th July 2015 18:30 - 20:00

##Abstract

Technological advances in all areas of life sciences have to led to a data explosion and require increasingly complex data analyses techniques. It can quickly become a nightmare for a single researcher to keep track of all the stages of their analysis pipeline without adequate documentation; let alone a researcher from another institute trying to repeat the same analysis and reach the same conclusions. In this masterclass, we will discuss how leading journals are becoming increasingly stringent in their requirements for reproducibility and give examples of how we have suceeded (and in some cases failed!) to rise to these challenges.

##Speakers

1. Dr Florian Markowetz (Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute)
2. Dr Gordon Brown (Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute)
3. Dr Stephen Eglen (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics)
